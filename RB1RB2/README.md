This is a repositary of all samples application that can run on RB1/2. Each sample application has its own folder. An introduction for every sample application is given below. Please follow the README in the respective folders to build, deploy and test. 
Attention: Please use POST-CS version meta and with rb-debug HLOS version to use sample-apps.


## 1. Codec2-Video
```
This app aims to help users to learn how to encode with h264 and decode the video with h264 on the Qualcom platform through this sample app.
```

## 2. RB1/2-Information(Device-info)
```
A command based App to get platform information.
from varying target types (GPUs, CPUs, USB, display, sensors and so on).
```

## 3. RB1/2-Platform(GPIO-samples)
```
A commands based app to get and set GPIO.
For control LED, set GPIO output, Button even catching, etc.
```
## 4. GstAlsaPlugin-Application
```
Based on gstreamer. The purpose is helping users to learn how to implement the playback and recording functions of gstreamer+alsa
on the QTI platform through this sample app.
```

## 5. Gstreamer-Applications
```
The purpose of these samples is helping users to learn how to implement the functions of gstreamer on the Qualcomm platform.
```

## 6. Gstreamer-TFlite
```
Gstreamer-TFlite is to show the label of object with TFlite using Gstreamer commands.
```

## 7. OpenCL-Application
```
OpenCL-Sample-code shows OpenCL from three examples.
"FFT" shows the use of OpenCL for fast Fourier transform;
"Benchmark" shows the reading and writing rate when the memory unit is respectively Byte, KB, MB;
"Matrix_multiply" shows the multiplication of two 20*20 matrices,And print out the results of the two input matrices and the multiplication of the two matrices on the screen
```

## 8. WIFI-On-Boarding
```
WIFI-On-Boarding mainly includes scanning the surrounding hotspots in STA mode, creating a new WIFI connection,
and obtaining the ssid and psk of the currently connected WIFI. After switching the SAP mode, you can create a
newhotspot and get the ssid and psk of the current hotspot.
```

## 9. Weston-Client-Application
```
Weston-Sample-code shows how to compile and run a simple client in Weston.
```

## 10. Camera-HAL3-Sample
```
The Camera-HAL3-Sample demo calls the camera through the Camera HAL API to complete the preview capture and video operations.
```

## 11. Snpe_classification
```
Classification is to show the label name of the object with Snpe using Gstreamer commands.
```

## 12. Snpe_detection
```
Detection is to frame the object and show the name of the object with Snpe using Gstreamer commands.
```

## 13. TFlite_classification
```
Classification is to show the label name of the object with TFlite using Gstreamer commands.
```

## 14. TFLite_Posenet
```
Posenet is to show the effect of pose recognition using Gstreamer commands.
```

## 15. TFLite_Segmentation
```
Segmentation is to show the effect of object segmentation using Gstreamer commands.
```

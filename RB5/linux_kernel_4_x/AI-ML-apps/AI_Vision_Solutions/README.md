# AI Vision Solutions using YoloV5 Model

### Introduction
There are different workplaces where the safety of the employee is at risk due to the nature of work. There could be a serious injury that can happen to the employee due to any uncontrollable reason. There are different AI solutions that can mitigate or reduce the risk of serious injury.
Other than Safety Solutions, There are more object detection use cases like Trash Detection, Damaged Box detection, and People counting that can be done using the YoloV5 model.
In this repository, we have implemented various AI use cases that can be implemented using the YoloV5 model on Qualcomm速 Robotics RB5 development platform.

We will discuss various object detection solutions that can be done using YoloV5:
1. People Intrusion Detection
2. Helmet Detection
3. Fire Detection
4. Crack Detection at the construction site
5. Trash Detection
6. People Counting
7. Damaged Box detection

To reduce and mitigate serious accidents, we have developed a set of safety solutions in various industries like Warehouses and Construction sites. These solutions will take input from IP camera and perform real-time input stream analysis on Qualcomm速 Robotics RB5 development Edge AI device. These solutions provide an end-to-end application that can be quickly integrated into a new build system.

### Solution Details
The application implemented the following vision-based object detection solutions:

**1. Intrusion Detection**

This is an operational safety issue detection case. If a person enters into restricted areas then AI edge device triggers an event.

**2. Fire Detection**

This is a building safety detection case. This Solution will detect if there is any fire or smoke. 

**3. Helmet Detection**

This solution will perform Helmet Detection for construction and warehouses.

# CE2.0 SI Tracker Solutions on LU.UM.2.0 build

### Introduction
Object Tracking is a combination of detecting object and assigning unique identity. In each consecutive frame the object will maintain its identity. Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at tracking objects of a single class or multiple classes. Here an object can be like persion, vehicle, luggage etc.


### Prerequisite
